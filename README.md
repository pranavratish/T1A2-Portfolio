### Mission Statement

The goal of this website is, to be accessible and showcase my ability, to potential employers looking to hire an eager and capable junior developer. The website also allows visitors to easily access information regarding past projects of mine and my insights into the topical events in the IT space through my blog. This ease of access also allows potential clients who may not be as comfortable with technology to consider utilising my skillset in order to achieve their software development based goals.

### Features of the Website

1. Navigation Bar
    
    The Navigation Bar is a visible component of the website only in tablet and desktop viewports. This feature allows the user to access the websites various pages and information efficiently, while also being simplistic in design so as not to overwhelm the user.

2. Footer + Links

    The Footer bar and the link icons in the Footer are a consitently reappearing feature on every page in the website. They allow users to quickly access social media and other tertiary websites that pertain to my eligibility as a potential employee or service provider through the link icons, which will redirect the user to a new window.

3. Collapsible Menu

    The collapisble menu will appear on the website when accessed on mobile devices. It replaces the navbar as an efficent tool for navigation of the website, while also taking up minimal space on the screen. When collapsed it is represented via a 'hamburger' icon in the top right hand corner of the screen.

4. Interactive Tile Links

    These tiles appear only on the Projects page of the website and redirect the user to relevant github or other pages that contain the contents of previous projects that I have worked on. The tile format allows the user to get a small glimpse and feel for the type of project and does a better descriptive job than mere text. The tiles will contain relevant images and have text that is accessbile to most, if not, all users.

5. Pop-out Window

    Also appearing only on the Projects page of the website this feature contains a tile, similar to the ones mentioned above, that will create a pop-out window upon interaction. This window will contain all accreditations and previous study history which will allow users to understand the ability and experience that I can provide, either as a potential employee, or a service provider.
